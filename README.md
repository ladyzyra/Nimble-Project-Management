# Nimble Project Management
Agile Methodology for Individuals

Nimble Project Management is a coding methodology adapted from Agile but for individuals. It takes the benefits of Agile and applies it to an individual setting. 

# Status: In Development

We are currently ironing out the manifesto to adopt the agile method for individuals. Hope in the dicussion and feel free to pull and propose any change you want. Be sure to explain the logical reason for doing so (how it would best help on individual terms). Anything labeled [NEEDS ADAPTION] is an agile method needing adaption for an individual.  

# Nimble Manifesto

Here is the Nimble Manifesto: (currently in development)

1. Customer satisfaction through early and continuous software delivery – Customers are happier when they receive working software at regular intervals, rather than waiting extended periods of time between releases. 

2. Accommodate changing requirements throughout the development process – The ability to avoid delays when a requirement or feature request changes. 

3.  Frequent delivery of working software – Scrum accommodates this principle since the team operates in software sprints or iterations that ensure regular delivery of working software.

4. [NEEDS ADAPTION] Collaboration between the business stakeholders and developers throughout the project – Better decisions are made when the business and technical team are aligned. 

5. [NEEDS ADAPTION] - proposal is to delegate]   Support, trust, and motivate the people involved – Motivated teams are more likely to deliver their best work than unhappy teams. 

6. [NEEDS ADAPTION] The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.  Enable face-to-face interactions – Communication is more successful when development teams are co-located. 

7. Working software is the primary measure of progress.  Working software is the primary measure of progress – Delivering functional software to the customer is the ultimate factor that measures progress. 

7. Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.  Agile processes to support a consistent development pace –Teams establish a repeatable and maintainable speed at which they can deliver working software, and they repeat it with each release. 

9. Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.  Attention to technical detail and design enhances agility – The right skills and good design ensures the team can maintain the pace, constantly improve the product, and sustain change. 

10. Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount of work not done--is essential.  Simplicity – Develop just enough to get the job done for right now. 

11. [NEEDS ADAPTION] The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.   Self-organizing teams encourage great architectures, requirements, and designs – Skilled and motivated team members who have decision-making power, take ownership, communicate regularly with other team members, and share ideas that deliver quality products. 

12. [NEEDS ADAPTION] At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.  Regular reflections on how to become more effective – Self-improvement, process improvement, advancing skills, and techniques help team members work more efficiently.
